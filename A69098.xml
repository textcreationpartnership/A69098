            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And bicauſe the vvel doings of the good and vertuous, and the diſorder of the euil &amp; vvicked might appeare to al poſteritie, that they may lerne therby to folovv the one, &amp; to leue the other, this author in this his ſaid diſcourſe (moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious princeſſe) hath ſet forth as it vver to the eie, hovv that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being deſcended of baſe &amp; vnknovvn bloud, through their vertue, great valiantneſſe and vvorthie acts, haue of a very ſmal beginning, ben aduanced to this noble eſtate of kings and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, vvho after they had atchieued the place of rule and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, by continuing their nobleneſſe and vvorthineſſe, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and vſing their authoritie vvel and prudently, haue meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted immortall fame and prayſe: and hovv that ſome others do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary, vvere (by the iuſt iudgement of God) shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ouerthrovvn and caſt dovvn from high eſtate and degree, to great vvretchedneſſe and miſerie, to their great reproche and ignomie for euer: by vvhich exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples the good may lerne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in vertue and nobleneſſe, and the vicious and inſolent ſee the frutes of their vvickedneſſe, and perceyue hovv that naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dooings haue alvvayes naughtie endes. And in the <hi>treatiſe of Peace and Warre,</hi> (moſt noble Princeſſe) added to this ſayd Author by the tranſlater therof out of the Latin into the french tong, there is at large ſet foorth the benefits and commodities of the one, and the diſcommodities and enormities of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: vvhereby all Kings and Princes may rather be moued to embrace and maynteyne peace and quietneſſe (as things moſte neceſſarie for all common vvealths) than any vvays be inclined to vvarre and crueltie (moſte pernicious and hurtfull) vvhiche
<pb facs="tcp:4854:4"/> bringeth nothing elſe but murthering of innocentes, rauishing of honeſt vviues and maidens, burning, ſpoyling and deſtroying of countreys, euen the very frutes of vvarre, and yet commonly that vvhiche is gotten vvith muche paynes, great expenſes, and vnmercyfull effuſion of chriſtian bloud, is oftentymes in one moment loſt againe. And therfore more praiſe shall thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſerue, that leaue their kingdomes to their ſucceſſors quiet and vvelthy, than thoſe that for the conqueſt of others haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouerished and diſturbed their ovvne. And bycauſe this ſayde treatiſe of Peace and vvarre dothe declare both the extremities as vvell vvhat number of beautifull cities haue ben edified, and vvhat greate countreys haue ben enriched by peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as alſo vvhat goodly regions and prouinces haue ben de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and ouerthrovvne by ſtryfe and vvarre, it is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for all Princes and Magiſtrates to ſpende ſome little tyme to reade the ſame, to the end they may thereby take occaſion ſo honourably to leade their liues, as after their deathes they may shyne to their poſteritie, and vvinne thereby euerlaſting fame and renoume. And in the other treatiſe of the daunger and hurt that doth grovv to a common vvelth by incontinencie, and of the commendation of Mariage (added alſo to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor by the ſaid tranſlater out of the latin into the French tong) is shevved and manifeſted (moſte vvorthy Princeſſe,) by many fearefull and horrible examples, hovve that the Lorde God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other ſinnes, hath moſt greuouſly plagued the vvorlde in all eſtates from age to age, for that abhominable and filthie ſinne of incontinencie, yea euen to the vtter ſubuerſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble regions and kingdomes, vvith the rooting out of the poſteritie of their kings and princes for euer.

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, thou</hi> ſhalte vnderſtande that this preſente Auctoure whoſe tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer here vnto thee, doth not folowe others of the Greekes and Latines, that haue entreted of the like matter, bicauſe they alway (wryting any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) were accuſtomed to aduertize them, how they ought to gouerne themſelues in mariage, and alſo to admoniſhe them that they ſhoulde flee from the companie of euill and wicked women, and to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and careful to cleanſe their dominions of all ſuch infections, as the onely things that tended to the vtter decay and ruine of them. Neyther doth he make any mention here howe Princes ought to eſchue wars and embrace peace, a thing ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as without the which, Gouernement is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether imperfect and maymed. He hath likewyſe omitted to exhorte Princes to banniſh out of their Courtes al Flatterers and other ſuch kinde of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4854:8"/> that do nothing elſe but fyl their eares with vnneceſſarie pleaſures and delights, whoſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe is onely to watche apte houres and tymes to feede them with toyes and fantaſies, wherin they do ſo well play their partes, that in the ende they corrupte them, although they be very good of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and well inclined. And if thou be curious to knowe the occaſyon, why the Authour hath ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and kept in ſilence, in the diſcourſe of thys Booke, things ſo neceſſarie for Regimente (ſeing he hath ſo wel entreated of the reſt) I can not tell any reſon therfore, other than (as I ſuppoſe) that he was preuented by death, being in purpoſe if he had liued longer, to haue performed thoſe points. And the cauſe that doth leade mee thus to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, is, for that there was founde of his doing (after his deceaſe) one Booke of Geographie, and another of Greeke Epigrams, that were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and vncorrected, which are at this preſente in the Kings Librarie to be ſene. And in place ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am enboldned (truſting vpon the good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thou wilt make of theſe my labours) to ioyne vnto it theſe three treatiſes beforenamed, of mine owne inuention, for the better and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect adourning of this worke: aſſuring thee, that I haue not ſo wel truſted in myne owne habilitie, nor preſumed of my ſelfe ſo much, but that I haue vſed therin the ayde of certein famous Latin Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and ſpecially in the Treatiſe of Peace and Warre, as thou mayeſt perceyue by the reading thereof. And as touching the other two, I haue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4854:8"/> perfourmed them rather by myne own labor and trauayle, than by any other meanes, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe are not to be condemned, although (as the Comicall Poete ſayeth) there is nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently there ſpoken, that hath not bene ſayd long before. The fyrſte Treatiſe, which is agaynſte Paraſites and Flatterers, thou mayeſt reade in my Prologue: and that of the excellencie of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the other of Peace and Warre, be the laſt two Chapters of this preſent Boke. Beſydes theſe things before named, I haue gathered oute of many good Authoures (by the perſuaſion of a friend of mine) the life, maners, religion and death of that monſter Mahomet, and ſhewed by what meanes and ſubtiltie he did ſeduce and cary away with him ſo many people. Al which things I praye thee fyrſt reade wyth good deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration before thou do iudge, and then I doubt not but thou ſhalt finde matter in them, that ſhal be to thy conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation &amp; comfort.</p>

Yea, and that in ſuch ſorte, that <hi>Sainct Dennis</hi> in his Booke <hi>Of the Deuine names,</hi> woondring at his greatneſſe and excellencie, was ſo bolde to call it a cleare I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and next to the deuine power, King without life, of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth,<note place="margin">The Fire is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than all the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome be of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie opinion.</note> which being without reaſon and vnderſtanding by nature, woorketh and exerciſeth his offices vpon the earth.

                  <note place="margin">Plin. lib 11.</note> where hée ſayth as followeth: The King of the Bées is alwayes of a faire forme,<note place="margin">The king of the Bees ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the other in gret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe and in beauty.</note> and is bigger than any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two times.

And it is a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing, to beholde and marke what obedience the others

You ſhall ſee rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him hys watche men and garde, who ſerue him by their preſence, for a defence. Hee neuer goeth abrode without hys garde: and it is eaſily knowne when hée will go, by a certain buzzing and noiſe which hée maketh a fewe dayes before hys departure, euen as it were for a warning to watch the houre and time of his going: and being abrode,<note place="margin">A maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Bees to their King.</note> if it happen that hée faint in his flying, they lift him vp againe and ſupport him on their feeble ſhoulders: and if hée bée vtterly ouercome wyth labour in his trauail, they beare him: &amp; if it fortune hée ſtray and go out of his way, they wander this way and that way, flying about to méete him againe, and whereſoeuer hée doth ſtay himſelf, all the reſt campe about him: if hée bée priſoner or captiue, they do alſo abide captiue with him, as thoughe it were a thing impoſſible for them to liue one houre wythoute their King. Afterwards hée addeth a thing more ſtrange and maruellous, how that they obſerue the rites and cuſtomes of the funerals in ſuch maner, that if one of them die, they draw him out of his place in their hiues,<note place="margin">Funerals bee obſerued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongs Bees.</note> and follow and accompany him, as wée commonly do at the funerall of the deade: and if it happen any of their Kings to die of any contagion or infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theſe little worms ſorrow and lament, and haue no more care or thought to ſerch for their liuings or nouriſhment, but remain ſtil in their hiues round about the corps, making their heauie complaints and miſerable lamentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and that with ſuch extremitie, that if no man bring them aught to féede vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they will rather famiſhe themſelues than ſéeke their meate. <hi>S.

As touching his bodie (ſayth hée) hée hath an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beautie and worthineſſe of ſhape, in the which he doth excéede al others, with alſo a maruellous gentleneſſe &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe in manners: for if hée haue any ſting (as ſome write hée hath) hée neuer vſeth it for any reuenge: for the lawes of Nature are not wrytten in letters, but are imprinted in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes heart and expreſſed in manners: for the more nobly any man is deſcended of bloud, and the higher in degrée of honour hée is placed, the more mercie and clemencie hée will vſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes thoſe that do offend him.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Afterwardes, continuing his diſcourſe of the Bées, hée addeth therevnto a matter moſt myraculous, which is: If they do at any time (ſayth hée) vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or tranſgreſſe the lawes of their Prince, they think they are condemned, and ſlea the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues preſently with their owne ſtings. The like thing at this day is vſed among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who of their owne méere will and without conſtraint of any other, do ſacrifiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by death, if by chaunce they haue offended, or declined from their duties in any thing towards their Prince or otherwayes. For there is no nation this day vnder the Sunne, that obſerueth their lawes ſo ſtraightly &amp; ſo ſeuerely as they do. And yet I dare aſſure you, that neither the <hi>Indians,</hi> nor the <hi>Samaites,</hi> nor the <hi>Perſians,</hi> haue not in greater eſtimation their Kings and Princes, than the lyttle ſillie Bées haue theyr Capitaine and Chéefe, who dare not preſume once to go out of their little cabinettes to ſearche for their meate,<note place="margin">A maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of beaſtes that they wil die for their Kings.</note> excepte their King goe before them. And finally they do put themſelues alwayes in defence for him, &amp; thinke it a commendable thing to aduenture their liues and to die in the defence of their Prince: and they bée ſo confirmed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued in good will and amitie towardes him, that as long as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4854:17"/> hée liueth, they will not render them ſelues ſubiecte to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but after that hée is deade to whom they did beare their firſt fayth, euen as altogether deſperat do preſently abandon their hiues, in token that hée who was their head and Chéefe hath taken his ende. Beholde loe the diſcourſe of <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> vpon this matter. I could like wiſe bring forth the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Vergilius, Columellus, Conſtantinus,</hi> and a gret num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of others. But I will ſtay and make an ende in rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this one matter which <hi>Mapheus Vegeus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mapheus Vegeus.</note> (a man of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular learning, and one that hath ſearched farre into the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities of the woorkes of Nature) wryteth in one dyſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein hée doth introduce the Sunne, the Earth and Golde, in a controuerſie for their dignities and woorthineſſe, where the Earth in defence of her cauſe, doth ſet foorth very well the manners, nature and conditions of theſe Fées euen after the opinion of <hi>Plinie, Ariſtotle,</hi> and other Authours. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the ſayde <hi>Sainct Ambroſe</hi> ioyneth to it this that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, which is muche to the purpoſe of our matter. It is a maruellous thing (ſayth hée) howe Nature ſheweth her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſance, namely in things ſo ſmall as theſe little beaſtes: by whoſe examples ſhée doth not onely inſtruct and teach Kings and Princes howe to indeuer themſelues in their offices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes their Subiectes, but alſo their Subiectes with what fidelitie and reuerence they ought to honour and obey them. And it is no ſtrange thing therefore, if the wiſe man do ſende theſe lither and vnprofitable perſons to the little Antes, that they may learne of them and by their induſtrie,<note place="margin">Men may receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>es.</note> howe to bée carefull, where hée ſayth, goe your wayes you ſlouthfull and ydle perſons to the little Antes, and marke well their doings and take good héede thereto, for they, althoughe they haue no Prince, Gouernour, or Ruler, yet alwayes they do prepare in the Sommer time their meat, and do during their harueſt lay vp great ſtoare for their liuings in the Winter. And in like maner wée are ſecretely taught by a hidden exhortation of Nature to beholde the conditions of theſe brute beaſts, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4854:18"/> to take good héede to their order and manner of liuing, to the ende that wée endued with reaſon, may learne of them (that are without reaſon) how wee ought to leade this our humain ſocietie: and by what prouidence Kings and Princes oughte to gouerne their ſubiectes: and contrariwiſe what obeyſance and reuerence is due to them. For all men by nature &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (although they ſometimes faile therin) are bound to loue and obey him that ruleth and gouerneth them: a puiſſance ſo great of nature, that ſhe extendeth her force likewiſe to brute and ſauage beaſtes. And <hi>Zenophon</hi> introduceth <hi>Socrates</hi> his maſter, that hée had in gret admiration why man was found more ingrate to hys gouerner and ruler than the brute beaſt, for it is not ſeene commonly (ſayth hée) that any other beaſt, how brutiſh ſo euer hée bée, to abuſe them that nouriſhe him, nor doth refuſe to obey to his paſtour and feeder,<note place="margin">Man more ingrate vnto his Ruler than brute beaſts.</note> as man doth. For the Shéepe folow the voice of their ſhepherd, the Swine followe their ſwineherde, the Birds loue them that féed them (although they bée inſenſible and fearful) and there cannot be ſhewed any other reſon why the dominion of the <hi>Perſians</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſo long (as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſayeth) but bicauſe they aboue all people did alwayes honour the Maieſtie Royal, and had it in a moſt ſingular eſtimation and reuerence: and thus hée doth conclude, that ſometimes it is moſt méete for vs to endure &amp; beare the imperfections of Princes, and that for a litle enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie wee may not loſe ſo great a benefit. Wée will nowe make an end of thoſe things, bicauſe that wée do ſpeak more amply of them in our nexte Chapter. And it is not without great cauſe that I haue ioined theſe little Antes and Bées to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, bicauſe amongs all other kinde of beaſts they bée the moſt induſtrious and moſt diligent, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> witneſſeth. Furthermore,<note place="margin">Cranes haue their captens and leaders.</note> the Cranes bee foules that flock and companie together (as <hi>S. Ierome</hi> writeth) when hée ſayth that inſenſible beaſtes followe their Captaines, as amongs the Bées there is an head, the Cranes followe their companions in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Whereby hée ſéemeth to proue that it is méete that there
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4854:18"/> bée one chéefe and head among al creatures, as in a Ship, one gouerner. And <hi>Rome</hi> could not ſuffer two brethren to raign together, but by the effuſion of the bloud of the one the other tooke place. Likewiſe in the wombe of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> the two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> coulde not accord, but fought together.<note place="margin">Geneſis. 25.</note> And <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> in his <hi>Hexameron,</hi> ſetteth out more at large this which <hi>S. Ierome</hi> hath ſayde briefly. The Cranes (ſayeth hée) chooſe themſelues one head or Captaine, and follow after him in the rearewarde: they doe appoynt certayne which by their crying ſhal ſtay the whole troup: they watch by courſe,<note place="margin">The watche of the Cranes</note> and they that watch do holde ſtones in their féete, to the ende that when they bée ouercome with ſléepe, the ſtones falling from them, they might awake by the noyſe therof: the others hauing theyr heads vnder their wings, do ſléep and take their reſt, ſtanding one while on one legge, and other whiles vpon the other: and their chéefe and Captaine being awaked, doth foreſée all daunger, and gyueth warning to the reſt. Thus it is nowe ſufficiently made playne and manifeſt vnto you, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well by the teſtimonie of the Eccleſiaſtical as the Prophane hyſtories, that Nature a moſt excellent woorker (whoo hath made nothing in vaine) hath giuen a certaine mark, caracter, and token of preheminence and Royaltie, euen among brute beaſts, to the end that being mooued and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked with the maruellous contemplation of theſe things, wée ſhould bée the more apte to receiue inſtructions how to yéeld obedience to our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Superiours and Gouernours.</p>

Beholde loe, a maruellous doctrine of Sainct Paule touching the obedience we ought to haue towards Kings and Princes and other Superiors. Let vs alſo marke the teſtimonie of Sainct Peter, touching the ſayde matter, who doth wholy confirme the ſame that Sainct Paule hath ſayde before:<note place="margin">1.

And <hi>Cicero</hi> the Ethnike in his ſecond boke of <hi>Offices</hi> hath ſhewed the ſame manner of Inſtitution of Kings, where hée ſayeth: It is not very like that Kings and Princes haue onely béene choſen and inſtituted out of the meaneſt ſorte as <hi>Herodotus</hi> hath written) but of others the moſt wiſe and aunciente,<note place="margin">Herodotus reprooued.</note> to the ende they might haue iuſtice the better exerciſed.

But why do wée bring forth any further matter to prooue the authoritie of Princes, ſeing Ieſus Chriſt himſelf was appointed King by his father vpon the holy hil of Sion, according to the Pſalmiſt.

Sainct <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hauyng vnderſtandyng of thys cruell ſlaughter too bée doone by the commaundemente of the Emperoure <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> was maruellous ſorrowfull, and vpon a tyme as the ſayde Emperour wold haue entred into the Church, he came before him, and forbad him to enter, and vſing his Epiſcopall authoritie, ſayde vnto hym: <hi>Theodoſius</hi> dooeſt not thou remember the butcherie that thou haſte cauſed too bée doone? arte thou ſo blynded wyth thys Imperiall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that thou haſte forgotten thyne offence?

Many aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philoſophers hauing conſidered man in all his partes, and comparing him wyth other beaſtes, did as it were qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with Nature, that ſhe had created him ſo imperfect and vile, to be ſubiect to ſo many myſeries and infirmities: in ſo much that they began to blaſpheme her, and cal her (in ſtede of a naturall mother,) a cruell ſtepmother. Lette vs note a little that great ſearcher of nature <hi>Plinie</hi> in the ſeuenth boke of his natural hiſtorie how he hath paynted out (in his right colours) this ambitious man, where he ſayth, Man dooth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his body with things growing of other beaſts, to whom Nature hath giuen to ſome feathers, to ſome haire, to ſome ſkinnes, to ſome ſcales, and to other ſome wool: and in lyke maner hath diſpoſed her fauour to herbes &amp; trées, which ſhe hath couered with barkes for a defence againſt the iniurie of the cold &amp; the violence of the heat: but as for man (ſayth he) euen as a thing borne before the time, and as it were in diſdayn and deſpite,<note place="margin">Weping and crying is mannes inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</note> ſhe hath broughte him foorth naked intoo the earthe, and in the daye of his natiuitie, hath giuen him Teares for his inheritance, whiche dothe prognoſticate his calamities and miſeries to come. Marke lo the chiefe of the workes of nature, who if he were abandoned the ayde and helpe of others, is ſo weake and féeble of himſelfe, that hée woulde bée eaten and deuoured by other wylde and cruell beaſtes. Behold well the actes and triumphs of him which ought vniuerſally to commaunde all, and for whoſe vſe all things are created and made: mark him I ſay, when he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out of the entrayles of his moother, and thou ſhalte ſée him layd bound vpon the earth,<note place="margin">Man only is borne to be furious and proud.</note> euen immouable as a ſtock or ſtone: and beholde him who is only borne to be furious and proud, beginneth his lyfe with paine and trouble, whoſe birth is onely the cauſe therof.

Wherefore ſome Philoſophers (as <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> and ſuche others) did duryng all their lyfe tyme, bewayle the calamities and miſeries of mankynd: For he always when hée paſſed thorough the ſtréetes, accompanyed his ſteppes with teares, for he did well conſider and ſée, that all our lyfe dyd conſiſte in nothing but miſerie and wretchedneſſe,<note place="margin">A Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher that did continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bewayle the humaine miſeries.</note> and all things wherein menne were exercyſed, did ſéeme vntoo him woorthy compaſſion, as well for their paine and trauell as for the offences and ſinne that they dyd dayly committe: And the better to conſider (at his pleaſure) of the miſerie of this our humain life, he ſequeſtred himſelf from out al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, and ſtrayed about in the deſerts, liuing vpon fruit and rootes. He did vpon a tyme write a letter to king <hi>Darius,</hi> (as <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> ſayeth) wherin he did aduertiſe him, that all the inhabitants of the earth were corrupted and wicked, and that they had Iuſtice in contempte and hatred, and gaue them ſelues to vayne glory and auarice, and that they were flatterers and couetous men: and ſéeing them thus oute of

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinually at the humaine miſeries.</note> but after a more ſtrange manner: for he always paſſing through the ſtreetes, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but laugh continually with open mouth: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demaunded of him the occaſion of his diſordinate laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he aunſwered, that the dooings of mankynde deſerued nothing elſe but perpetuall mockerie, and that all our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine lyfe was but vanitie and fooliſhneſſe: and all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and appetites of men were but fondneſſe, grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ambition, auarice, hatred, malice, and ſuche other lyke vices. And hee béeing thus plunged into the contemplation of theſe things, wente vp and downe the ſtréetes laughing, as the other did weeping. Other Philoſophers write, that it had ben good for man neuer to haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borne, or elſe as ſoone as he was born, preſently to haue died. <hi>Theodorus</hi> a Gréeke Poet by theſe verſes folowing doth confirme the ſame.</p>

                  <hi>Galerius</hi> alſo ſurnamed Neatherde (bicauſe bothe he and his parentes were alwayes rurall men) was likewiſe choſen Emperor. <hi>Elius Pertinax</hi> in like manner Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> was a Marchant of Wode, which eſtate he exerciſed with ſuche trauaile and paine, that he was in that reſpecte <hi>Pertinax.</hi> And <hi>Diocleſianus</hi> the Emperor, who did make <hi>Rome</hi> to wonder at his triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phal victories was but a ſeruaunt, and the ſonne of a Booke binder. <hi>Bonoſus</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Emperor was the ſonne of a Scholemaſter. <hi>Aurelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (whoſe renoume is immortall) was borne of ſo baſe a ſtocke, that in the Hiſtories can not be founde the place of his birth.

Secondly where you ſay I beare no reuerence nor honor to the Churches, that is bicauſe I know the gods make more account of a good and pure heart, than of many Churches al to bedecked with gold &amp; ſiluer. As touching the Prieſts, you ſay I put them to death: in déede I haue done it, thinking to make a good ſacrifice of them to the Gods, for they were ſo diſſolute, and ſo farre out of order in all their actions and dooings, that in ſtéede of honoring the Gods they were rather a ſlaunder vnto them.

               <p>Which thing alſo <hi>Plato</hi> the Ethnicke, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> his ſcholler, voide of the knowledge of the Goſpell, guided only by the goodneſſe and bountie of Nature, do full well recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe the ſame, when the one in the fifth booke of his common wealth ſaith that man dothe rule and gouerne ouer the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as the ſhepheard ouer the ſhéepe: And the other in his Politikes ſaith that man by kinde dooth know the aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and power that he hath ouer the woman; and nature hir ſelfe (a witneſſe irreprouable) doth manifeſt vnto vs ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently in hir works the very true portraict &amp; image of this ſubiection and obeyſance. For doe we not ſee that amongs al beaſts as wel the airie and watrie, as alſo thoſe that liue vpon the earth, the males do always co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund the females?

And further if we will be curious to ſearch into the ſecretes of the auncient hiſtories, we ſhal finde more ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger things (and yet true alſo) that is, that in the olde time the huſbands had power ouer their wiues and children, as well for death as life (as <hi>Ceſar</hi> a great aucthor hath left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in wryting) but ſuche vnnaturall power was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes ſtayed and ended by the mightie hande of God,<note place="margin">Caeſar in his comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries.</note> that it ſhould be no more lawfull for man to abuſe them in that ſorte, or to vſe them as drudges. For as his pleaſure was to make the woman of mannes owne fleſh, and drawe hir out of his ſide, ſo he woulde that he ſhoulde entreate hir as his faithfull friend and euerlaſting companion. And if you finde in any place of the holy ſcriptures, that our Lord God dothe any thing abaſe the woman, or make hir inferior to hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ye ſhal finde in a great numbre of other places, that he dothe magnifie hir, exalte hir, and fauoure hir before man,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:4854:99"/> and ſpecially at the beginning of the vniuerſall creation, where he honored the firſt woman with this title or name <hi>Eue,</hi> which is to ſay, life, and as for man, he called him <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> which is to ſay, earth, and not thinking that ſufficient,<note place="margin">Women fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored of God.</note> but did create hir in a noble place, that is to ſay, Paradiſe terreſtre, but man was made in the open fieldes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards carried into Paradiſe: and the woman alſo was created of a moſte noble ſubſtaunce, that is to ſay, of the fleſh and ſide of man (a matter made pure, liuely and quick) but he created man of an element groſſe and heauy, that is to ſay, of the ſlyme and excrements of the earth. And Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a ſoueraigne framer of all things, willing to ſignifie vnto vs what remembraunce and eſtimation we ought to haue of the woman, hath giuen hir a certayne priuiledge aboue man (after the opinion of the Philoſophers) and that is, if the man and the woman ſhall happen to be drouned at one inſtant, the man is firſte vnder the water, and the woman by the very prouidence of Nature, doth remayne long aboue the water. And further, for a certayne reuerence (as an eſpeciall grace and fauour of Nature) when ſhe flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth ſhe turneth vppon the water, hir backe vpwarde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heauen, and his face, and the reſte of hir body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the water: but man after he is drouned turneth his face vpwarde.

And as for my parte, the reaſons that hath moued me to rehearſe theſe few things of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations mentioned before, doth not tende to any other ende, but to induce men which haue giuen them ſelues vp to their wanton luſtes to marry, ſéeing that it is the chiefe remedie that our Lorde God hath giuen to man for a conſolation and eaſe of his infirmitie: and beſides mariage is a thing ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for man, that it is the onely conſeruator and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of our beginning,<note place="margin">The first mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racle that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Christ dyd was at a mariage.</note> which Ieſus Chryſt in token that he would haue it highly honored, being bidden to a mariage did enriche it and beautifie it with the firſt miracle that euer he did vpon the earth.

But what maketh the dignitie and excellencie of mariage more commendable than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of the diuine Nature with the humanitie (a thing dreadfull not onely to the Angels, but alſo to the wycked ſpirites) which ſurely is to vs a teſtimonie moſt certayne and true of the loue that the Lord God doth beare towards his church, of the whiche he calleth him ſelfe huſbande, and hir the ſpouſe: wherefore <hi>S.

But why doo we repoſe our ſelues ſo muche vppon the teſtimonie of the lawes written, ſéeing that we haue the very proper law of nature to confyrme the ſame, which is not written in any Table of Braſſe or mettall, but in grauen and printed in the inwarde partes of our hearts, whervnto if wée doo not obey and giue place, wée ſhall ſeeme ſo muche vnworthy the name of good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, as we thereby deſerue not to bée called men. For if it bée as the <hi>Stoikes</hi> doo ſay very ſubtilly in diſputation, that to liue well, is none other thing but to folow the courſe of Nature: what is more agreable to Nature than mariage? what is more conformable to the nature, not onely of man, but alſo of al other beaſts, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerue their kind in their béeing? it is then a thing very ignomious to man, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth great infamy to ſée beaſtes that are without reaſon to obey to the lawes of Nature, and he onely breake it, and ſtriue agaynſt it, and we (if we will marke well with Iudgement) ſhall finde in all the workes of Nature a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne

And <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> the great ſearcher of the ſecretes of Nature, doth write in his naturall Hyſtorie, that there are many trées and Plantes, whereof there is bothe the Male and the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, which of a very inſtinction of nature, and a ſecret and mutuall loue that is amongs them, do loue one an other, and take ſtrength and encreaſe of the one with the other, in ſuch ſorte,<note place="margin">A certaine ſimilitude of mariage in inſenſible things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life</note> that if the male ſhould not alwayes ſpred the bowes and braunches of the female, as it were by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall embracing, the females ſhould become barren, &amp; would beare no fruite. The Philoſophers write alſo the like of many precious ſtones, which are ſo well tied &amp; confederate togithers by the ſtrayte bonde of nature, that if ye ſeparate the male from the female, they can not exerciſe nor worke their naturall operations. And do wée not ſée how that the heauen in his continuall motion hath the earth in ſubiection as a wife and companion? which he maketh fruitfull &amp; fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till in all things by his ſtrenght and influence, doing therin the office of a faythfull ſpouſe and huſbande. And thus if we ſhould folow an infinite number of ſuche like examples which nature doth repreſent in hir works, we might make a great volume therof: but we haue brought foorth theſe few to ſhew you as it were at the eye, that by the ayde, ſolace, comfort &amp; fauor of this matrimoniall ſocietie, all things are mainteined, conſerued, &amp; continued, as to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary, if men were reſtrayned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame, al things ſhold be deſtroyed, made ruinate, and decayed: and there is not at this day any nation (vnder the face of the heauens) ſo cruell, barbarous, or ſo far eſtraunged from humanitie, that dothe not reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence &amp; honor mariage. The <hi>Thracians, Sarmates, Indians, Greke</hi> and <hi>Latinis,</hi> yea euen thoſe that dwell in the extreme parts of the world do receiue it, honor it, &amp; commend it, and that onely bicauſe that nature (the father and mother of all things) knowing our neceſſitie therin hath determined it, and engrauen it in our harts, yea &amp; it is of ſuch force, that it
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4854:102"/> taketh place, not onely amongs the Turtles &amp; Doues (who are of nature amorous) but further it vrgeth and conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the moſt furious &amp; cruel beaſts vpon the earth to obey thervnto. The Lions be louing &amp; gentle to their females,<note place="margin">The brute beasts that are without reaſon haue a maruellous affection to their fawnes.</note> the Beares and Elephants do not onely loue them, but are ſubiecte withall to that extremitie which we call gelouſie. The Tygers fight &amp; combate for the defence of their yong Faunes: The Aſſes which be of nature melancolie, be ſo earneſt defenders of their yong ones, that the philoſophers write, they will paſſe through the fire to defend and ſuccour them, and as that man therfore is not to bée eſtemed a good laborer that doth onely content him ſelfe to continue and preſerue the tées which he hath found planted by his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceters, except he alſo endeuer him ſelfe to plante others to ſerue his poſteritie: So in lyke maner he is not to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a good and profitable Citizen, that dothe thinke the people that are in the common wealthe where he inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth to be a number ſufficient, excepte he doo enforce him ſelfe to augment and encreaſe the ſame for the tyme to come, and to yéelde to hys poſteritie by Nature, that which he hath receyued of hys Aunceters. And alſo if we will enter into our ſelues, and iudge indifferently of things, what ſhall wée finde in this caducall and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie worlde more meeter for man than a woman? what is there more pleaſaunt and profitable to mans contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (béeing ſubiecte to many myſeries and calamities) than to communicate dayly at his owne libertie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that with mutuall good wyll, with his faythfull wyfe, the kéeper of all hys ſecretes, and faythfull trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſourer of all hys paſſions and ſorrowes? and as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng other humayne frendeſhippes, for the moſte parte they bée full of guyles, dyſſimulations and periuries: and oftentymes when Fortunes dothe frowne vppon vs, ſuche friendes become lyke vnto Swallowes, which take their flight in the winter, and if it happen a man to finde a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:4854:103"/> faythfull frende, oftetimes the frendſhip dothe not continue betwéene them tyll deathe, for mens natures are ſo diuers, that commonly they embrace a new frende, and leaue the olde: but the frendſhip and loue of Matrimonie is not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or infected by any Hypocriſie or diſſimulation, nor is neuer taken away nor extincte by the furious aſſaults of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe fortune, but it continueth euen vnto the graue, yea oftentimes it endureth for euer. But what more greater teſtimonie of feruent amitie can there bée, than to leaue the father and mother, brother and ſiſter, and generally all the race ſhe is deſcended off, yea and euen to become enimie to hir ſelfe to folow his huſbande, whom ſhe honoreth and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and haue all other things in miſliking, and depende wholly of him.

And where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can not giue vs but one father and one mother, marriage doth preſent vnto vs many children, who doo reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour vs, and wée holde them as deare vnto vs, as our owne fleſhe, who when they are yong and little ones
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:4854:103"/> doe with their pratlings, in learning to ſpeake, and others their toyes and fantaſies, giue vs ſuch pleaſure and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of minde, that it ſeemeth nature hathe giuen them to vs as things to deceiue the time, and to paſſe ouer parte of this our miſerable liues. If we be aſſéeged with olde age (a thing that is common to all men) they doe comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue vs therein vntill death come, and then they render vs to the earthe from whence we came, they be our bones, our fleſhe, and our bloud, and ſéeing them, we behold and ſée our owne ſelues, who do make the memorie of vs neuer to die, and do as it were make vs immortall. And further, they do procreate and engender others after vs, as do twigges that are cut off from any trée, and grafted vppon an other, bring forthe the like. Some nice perſons will allow very well of mariage, that it is holy, commendable, and profitable for the conſeruation of our liues, ſo farre foorthe as it be well accompliſhed in all pointes, and that nothing goe a wrie: but if it chance the woman to be vnhoneſt, the children vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie and out of order, with ſuche other incommodities, which oftentimes accompanie the marriage, what rage? what furie? what Roſes among thornes? what Worm wood with Honey? what pleaſantneſſe mixed with bitterneſſe is there then ſay they: But I do fully anſwere ſuch nice Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that be ſo curious in their affections, ſo delicate in their pleaſures, and that thinke nothing well excepte it be ſeaſoned with the ſauce of their owne appetites, that ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes and infirmities that continually folow in mariage, doe not procéede of the cauſe of marriage it ſelfe, but often times of mannes naughtineſſe,<note place="margin">The vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds giue occaſion to their wiues to be diſcrete and wiſe</note> according to the olde Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, whiche ſayth: an euill man maketh an euill woman, which <hi>Cato</hi> (a very ſeuere man in al his doings, but yet iuſt and right in this) dothe confirme, ſaying: that it is a more harder thing to finde a good huſbande, than a good Senator: Bicauſe that the moſt part of women that are become viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are commonly infected and made naughte by the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4854:104"/> liues and euill examples of their huſbands, who ought to be as lampes that ſhould ſhine vnto them by the well ordring their manners. For if they be ſpotted or defiled with any maner of vice or crime, it is very contagious and dangerous for their wiues. Behold loe, how often times we doe accuſe matrimonie (that is pure and neate in it ſelfe) which if it had a tung and coulde ſpeake, wold complaine of vs. <hi>Petrark</hi> (a great reuerencer of chaſtitie) in his Dialogue of the remedie of aduerſe fortune, wryteth, that it is very ſeldome ſeene, a wanton huſband to haue a chaſte wife: as contrary a wiſe and chaſt huſband, an vnchaſte wife, which thing <hi>Plutarch</hi> confirmeth in his connubial precepts: when he ſaythe that the huſbands that is giuen to be common, and that giueth himſelf in pray to other wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſetteth an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne and marke at his gates to conuey others to do the like to his owne wife. <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> that greate Father of the Churche in his Booke <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi> exhorteth men to be the ſame to their wiues that they woulde haue their wiues to be to them, if you deſire ſayth he, to haue your wiues mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, chaſte, and ſobre, you, which are the heades and chéefe, muſt giue the firſt teſtimonie and example in your ſelues: (and yet he concludeth that very hardely any chaſte man ſhall bridle a vicious and an impudente woman, or a wiſe and diſcrete man a fooliſhe woman: bicauſe oftentimes God dothe puniſhe the one of them by the other:) which leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Seneca</hi> (the moſte vertuous of the Ethnicke Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers) did not forgette to haue in remembrance when he wrote to <hi>Lucillus,</hi> who prayed him he woulde teache him to make a drinke, and the certaine receipte therof, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poyſon therein, which ſhould haue vertue to cauſe him to be beloued of his wife,<note place="margin">A louing drink to cauſe a man to be beloued of his wife.</note> without vſing any ſorcerie or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4854:104"/> ſuch meaſure of loue towardes hir, as thou doeſt couette to receiue of hir againe. Notwithſtanding al theſe aucthorities afore reherſed, yet I am well aſſured that many wil not be ſatiſfied nor anſwered in thoſe things: for there are ſome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtand ſo much in their owne fooliſhneſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thinke they ſhall win themſelues great fame to inuey againſt mariage, who for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better proofe of their mater, wil alleage many wicked marriage and vnluckie matches greatly diſpleaſing God, wherin ther hath ben fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſome women ſo diſſolute &amp; ſo far out of order in their liues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue not thought it inough to violate and breake the matrimoniall honor, but alſo (as women rooted in all miſcheefe) haue poiſoned, killed &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered their owne huſbands, yea and embrued their handes in the bloud of their naturall children, a thing ſo deteſtable, that the Hiſtoriographers haue had in horror, and greatly feared to put the ſame in wryting. But I will deſire ſuche curious gentlemen that folow the nature of Serpents, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all that they touche into venime, that they will put in ballance againſt theſe monſtruous marriages (whiche they ſpeake of) an infinite numbre of other mariages ſo wel mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched &amp; accompliſhed in al things, that it ſéemed that heauen &amp; nature did take great paine to frame them, for a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their worthineſſe, and that in ſuche ſorte, that neither death, nor time it ſelfe (that putteth all things in forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) cannot take away the memorie of them amongs me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for example, the loue of <hi>Alceſtes</hi> with hir companion, the loue of <hi>Iules</hi> with his <hi>Pompey, Parcia</hi> with <hi>Cato, Artemiſia</hi> with hir ſpouſe, <hi>Hipſicrates</hi> with the great king <hi>Mithridates</hi> and many others rehearſed in the holy Scriptures, which haue bene ſo ioyfull to them, that they haue not onely tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed and reioyced in the ſorowe and tormentes hapning vnto them for the ſame, but euen in deathe it ſelfe, ſo that for one which yée ſhall finde condempned in the Hiſtories, yée ſhall finde a Million of others commendable and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:4854:105"/>
               <p>But if we will trie all eſtates that doe liue or be dead with ſuche a touche ſtone, and wey all our actions in ſo iuſte a ballance, where hath there bene any founde ſo holy in this mortal life that hath not haulted or offended in ſome thing? And that the ſame ſhall not be founde vntrue, note the firſt eſtate of this world was made of two perſones, that is the man &amp; woman, who both two did offend. The ſecond eſtate which was their two children, the one was a murtherer of the other his brother. The third eſtate which was <hi>Noe,</hi> was derided of his children, wherewith the Lorde our God was offended. Let vs goe further to the kings, ye ſhall finde that <hi>Dauid</hi> was a good man, and <hi>Saule</hi> an euil man, amongs the Prophets, <hi>Daniel</hi> a good man, and <hi>Balaam</hi> wicked: amongs the eſtate of widowhead <hi>Iudith</hi> a good woman, and <hi>Ieſabell</hi> an euill woman: amongs rich men <hi>Iob</hi> was good, and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> curſſed: in the eſtate of Apoſtles. <hi>S.

Beholde nowe then howe to be either good or badde, it commeth not of the eſtate of marriage, but of oure naughtineſſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt inclination: As yée ſee of the ſwéete floure the Bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth Honie, and the Spider poyſon. There is yet one thirde kinde of people, which be the moſte fondeſt and moſt ſcrupulous of all others, for they be ſuche, that what ſo euer thing is offered to them, if it be not confirmable to their owne ſenſuall appetite, they can not diſgeſt it. And if they feele the leaſt annoyance in the worlde in marriage, it is to them a hot iron which burneth and tormenteth them, ſo that they diſdaine and refuſe it, and wiſhe that the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thereof were vtterly extincte and forgotten. Such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of people complaine of marriage, bicauſe ſay they, it is an heauie burden, a very ſea of miſchéefe, and an extréeme ſeruitude: ſpecially for the vnquietneſſe of the women who are alwayes complaining, if they lacke any thing at any time, they neuer ceaſe to torment and vexe their huſbands.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:4854:105"/>
               <p>I would demaund of ſuche Nicets, how they can endure any greeuous iniurie of their enimies,<note place="margin">An anſwere to them that do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of mariage.</note> when they can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide any light offence of their wiues, (their companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and continuall friendes) or the exclamation of their children which they haue bred and brought vp into this world? For as much as ſuche troubles be common, and as it were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to marriage, and that many there be for that reſpecte do contemne marriage, I wil ſtudie to ſatiſfie their delicate deſires and appetites at more leiſure. But for this preſent it ſhall ſuffiſe me to aduertiſe them when they féele them ſelues tempted with impacience, and that they can not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any ſmall offence of their wiues and children, let them remembre what offences they do daily commit to our Lord God, and they ſhall alwayes beare things paciently, and in a moment God will turne it to duſt. And he will not onely doe this for them, but further he will aide them with the cleareneſſe of the Sunne, the lightneſſe of the Moone, with the vertue of the elements, with the frutes of the earth, and with other infinite neceſſaries of his goodneſſe and mercie.

Let vs marke withall (impaciente and ingrateful men that we are,) that of his ſorow came our ioy, of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie grew our health, and that of his death, was deriued our life, and we ſhall be aſhamed and bluſhe that we do not beare the infirmities and weakneſſe of our houſholde, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmall offence of our wiues, who ſometimes forced euen vppon iuſt cauſe or choler, is conſtrained for the infirmitie that is in hir to ſay vnto vs with anger, that which ſhée can
